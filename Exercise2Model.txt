# Cognitive behavioural therapy for PTSD: Is PE more effective than the baseline PC?

model{

# likelihood of the data
y.PE ~ dbin(theta.PE, n.PE)
y.PC ~ dbin(theta.PC, n.PC)

# prior distributions, this is non-informative prior choice 
theta.PE ~ dbeta(41,66)
theta.PC ~ dbeta(46,86)

# contrast this is the main output of this exercise 
RR <- theta.PC/theta.PE
